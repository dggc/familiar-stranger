This is a sample project to demonstrate the usage of SINALGO, in particular the 
asynchronous simulation mode.

1  How to run this sample
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 a) Run this project in GUI mode, and start by creating network nodes:
    - Click on the menu 'Graph' -> 'Generate Nodes', and create 100 nodes. 
      The selected models should already match.
      
 b) This project demonstrates the asynchronous mode, where the connections of the
    nodes are not updated automatically. However, the configuration of this project
    is set such that prior to the very first step, the connections are updated. Thus, 
    press once on the run-button to evaluate the connections. Alternatively, select 
    'Graph' -> 'Reevaluate Connections' to obtain the same result.
 
 c) The asynchronous mode is event-based. Before anything can happen, a first event 
    needs to be generated. The nodes implement several methods that you can trigger 
    through their popup-menu: Right-click on a node and select one of the methods. 
    Then, note that one or several events are added in the event queue. Execute the 
    events by clicking on the run button. 
  
 d) You may issue several parallel events that overlap each other.
 
 e) Note that redrawing the network after each step is quite slow. Increase the 
    refresh rate to not repaint the network after each event.
 
2  Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This project also demonstrates the usage of user defined interactions through the GUI: 
   - custom methods for the nodes from the popup menu
   - globally visible custom methods from the drop-down menu
   - globally visible custom methods with a button
   - Node-selection
