This is a sample project to demonstrate the usage of SINALGO. It implements
mobile nodes that avoid obstacles placed on the deployment field.

1  How to run this sample
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 a) Run this project in GUI mode, and start by creating network nodes:
    - Click on the menu 'Graph' -> 'Generate Nodes', and create 100 nodes. 
      The selected models should already match.
     
 b) Start the simulation by pressing the start button.


2  Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This sample demonstrates the usage of a background map, which is an image that
 is projected onto the deployment area. The nodes are programmed to move according
 to a random waypoint model, but cannot cross any colored region. The names of the
 models stems from the idea that the colored regions describe lakes, which are not
 traversable. 
 
 While moving, the nodes remember which other nodes they have already seen. The 
 drawing size grows with the number of neighbors this node once had. The node(s) 
 which have seen most of the other nodes draw themselves in red.
 
 Remain with the mouse on a node to obtain a tooltip, which says how many of the
 remaining nodes the selected node has already seen. 
 
 Right-click on a node and select 'Color Neighbors' to color all nodes that the
 selected nodes has seen so far.
