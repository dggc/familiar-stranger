This is a sample project to demonstrate the usage of SINALGO. It implements a small
cellular network consisting of fixed antenna nodes and mobile nodes. 

1  How to run this sample
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 a) This project is easiest to launch from the command-line, where you can specify
    that SINALGO creates an initial set of nodes with the following arguments:
    
    -project sample3 
    -gen 49 sample3:Antenna sample3:GridDistribution NoMobility
    -gen 2000 sample3:MobileNode Random RandomDirection
 
    This will create a set of 49 antennas, distributed on a grid, and connected
    according to the AntennaConnection distribution model. Also, it creates a set
    of 2000 mobile nodes, which are randomly distributed and will move according to the
    random way point mobility model.

 b) Run the simulation for a couple of rounds
 
 c) Right-click on one of the mobile nodes and select to send an SMS to anohter 
    node, pick a node and continue with the simulation. The SMS is then sent over the
    antenna network to the selected node.


2  Behavior
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The antennas form a backbone of the network through which all traffic (SMS) is sent.
 The antennas are mutually connected - they communicate with each other via the 
 sendDirect method, which does not require a connection between the two nodes.
 
 The mobile nodes constantly move, and listen to the invite messages sent by the antennas.
 Whenever a node is invited by an antenna that is closer than the antenna the node is currently
 registered with, it registers with the new antenna.
 
 The mobile nodes may send messages (SMS) that are routed over the antennas. The mobile
 node sends the SMS to its antenna. If the antenna knows the receiver, the antenna forwards
 the SMS directly to the receiver. Otherwise, the antenna sends the message to all other 
 antennas, which deliver the SMS, if the receiver is registered with them.
 
 Upon receiving an SMS, a mobile node sends back an acknowledgement message. When the sender 
 does not receive such an ACK within a given time (currently 8 rounds), it resends the SMS.

 This project demonstrates how you may provide a customized appearance of nodes and
 edges. Note the circle around each antenna, which indicates its coverage radius, and
 the differently colored edges.
