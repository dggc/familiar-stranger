This is a sample project to demonstrate the basic usage of SINALGO. Mobile nodes
are placed in a 3D cuboid, where they move around and send messages.

1  How to run this sample
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 a) Run this project in GUI mode, and start by creating network nodes:
    - Click on the menu 'Graph' -> 'Generate Nodes', and create 500 nodes. 
      The selected models should already match.
     
 b) Right-click on at least one node, and select 'start' from the popup-menu. 
    This schedules the selected node to send an initial message.

 c) Start the simulation by pressing the start button.


2  Behavior
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Each S1Node behaves as an infinite, but delayed repeater of messages it receives.
 This works as following: Whenever an S1Node receives a S1Message (whose content is
 an int value), it starts a timer to forward the message. When the timer fires, the 
 node selects its neighbor with the smallest ID and forwards the message to this 
 node. Then, the timer is reset and the process is repeated forever.

 The delay is determined by the int value of the message, and an increment value, 
 specified in the config file. 
  
 Note: This is a rather academic example and not intended to represent any 
       realistic algorithm!


3  GIU
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The nodes are drawn as circles with two numbers: The total number of messages 
 sent by the node, and the number of messages sent in this round. 
  

4  Diverse
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Note that the project uses a log file and accesses custom entries of the 
 project configuration file.
  
 To generate an initial point-sent from the command-line, the following parameters
 can be used:
    -project sample1 -gen 500 sample1:S1Node Random RandomDirection
